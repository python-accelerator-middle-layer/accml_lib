        where to break async / sync or threaded approach?

    I assume today that the calculation engine works the following way:

    1. set to a state
    2. then calculations are triggered

    So the calculations shall only happen after the state was
    set (completely).This is not (and can not) directly observed
    here. Here the calculation is only conducted when its results
    are requested. Calculation, setting, and  reading back
    calculation results are protected by a lock, so no more sets
    are made while calculation is running nor calculation results
    are delivered ahead of time.
